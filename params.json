{"name":"Oceancolor Data Downloader v1.0","tagline":"QGIS plugin to download data from NASA Oceancolor","body":"##What it does\r\nThis is a QGIS Plugin which allows easy download of oceancolor and sea surface temperature data from [NASA Oceancolor](http://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/). \r\n\r\nIt downloads either global [level 3 mapped](http://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/cms/products) chlorophyll-a concentrations or sea surface temperatures within a defined time range, and resolution. The data is saved in GeoTiff format and can be added to the QGIS canvas once downloaded.  \r\n\r\n\r\n##The data\r\nAll data is sourced from [NASA Oceancolor](http://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/). Full details on the input data can be found [here](http://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/), and includes [algorithm descriptions](http://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/cms/atbd). \r\n\r\nThe plugin currently provides access to three datasets:\r\n\r\n* MODIS AQUA CHL-a concentration\r\n* SeaWiFS CHL-a concentration\r\n* MODIS AQUA Night Sea Surface Temperatures\r\n\r\n\r\n##Installation\r\n\r\nThe plugin requires QGIS version 2.0 or higher. It can be installed via the Plugin Manager. \r\n\r\n1. Navigate to `Plugins > Manage and Install Plugins...`\r\n\r\n2. Click `Settings`\r\n\r\n3. If it isn't already setup, add the Official QGIS plugin repository:\r\n\r\n    `http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/plugins.xml`\r\n\r\n4. Click on `New` to see all newly available plugins. \r\n\r\n5. Install the plugin, named **Oceancolor Downloader**.\r\n\r\n##Using the plugin\r\n1. ![Toolbar button](images/icon-button.png)  Locate this icon on the toolbar and click it to open the plugin.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n![Plugin interface](images/interface.png)\r\n\r\n2. Select a **dataset**, a **time period**, a **date range** and a **download path**. Select whether you wish to add the composite to the map canvas. \r\n\r\n3. Click **Download**\r\n\r\nIf you have chosen to add the data to the canvas, it will appear styled once the GeoTiff is created. Sea surface temperature data will also include a seperate quality grid, but this will not be added to the canvas. \r\n\r\n\r\n![SST](images/sst-map.png) \r\n\r\n\r\n##Future developments\r\n\r\nWe are currently developing new features and working to improve existing ones. A selection of features we are looking to include in a future release are as follows:\r\n\r\n* Alternative output file formats\r\n* Options to subset output data to a lat/long bounding box\r\n* Other datasets, such as [Net Primary Production](http://www.science.oregonstate.edu/ocean.productivity/)\r\n* Progress bar\r\n* 'Cancel Download' button\r\n* Warnings/notifications on amount of data selected to download\r\n\r\n\r\n##Acknowledgements\r\n\r\nThe plugin was developed by the Mapping and Geographic Information Centre at [British Antarctic Survey](http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/). \r\n\r\n\r\n![BAS logo](images/bas-logo.jpeg)\r\n![NERC logo](images/nerc-logo.jpg)\r\n\r\nIf using this plugin for work towards a publication, please cite: [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/9975/antarctica/oceancolor_downloader.svg)](http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15018)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
