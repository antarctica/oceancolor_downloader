oceancolour-downloader
======================

##What is it

QGIS plugin to allow easy download and use of earth observation datasets with QGIS. 

##Currently...

Access CHL-a concentrations from NASA Oceancolour. Download annual datasets given a date range. Unzip them and convert to Geotiff. 

##The plan

1. Choice of SST or CHL-a
2. Choice of monthly or annual

##Implementation

1. make the functions into a class.
2. think about how to split into individual functions a bit more
3. add another optional dataset - SST
4. add functionality for monthly range
